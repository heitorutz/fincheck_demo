# FINCHECK

This project was created using React and vite as the build tool, Nest Js on backend, both sides using Typescript.
For the database I've used prisma as the ORM and PostgreSQL on docker to run on a container.
Also, on the frontend was used React Query, React Hook Form and zod for form validations.

this is only a demonstration of my job!
